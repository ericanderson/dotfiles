# SSH Configuration Management
#
# This config uses an Include directive to support machine-specific configurations:
# - This file: Base SSH configuration managed by chezmoi
# - ~/.ssh/local_config: Machine-specific host configurations (not managed by chezmoi)
# 
# To add machine-specific SSH hosts, edit ~/.ssh/local_config directly.
# This allows different SSH hosts on each machine while sharing common settings.

# Include machine-specific SSH configurations
Include {{ .chezmoi.homeDir }}/.ssh/local_config
