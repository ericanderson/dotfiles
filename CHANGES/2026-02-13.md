# Changes for 2026-02-13

## New Git Worktree Helper Script
- Added `bin/executable_gwt-claude` - Git worktree helper that creates worktrees and opens Claude Code
- Creates worktrees at `{repo-root}.worktrees/{branch-name}` following the repository convention
- Automatically opens Claude Code in the new worktree
- Supports tmux integration: creates new tmux window named `claude-{branch-name}` if running in tmux
- Falls back to direct execution when not in tmux
- Usage: `gwt-claude <branch-name>`

## Implementation Details
- Standalone bash script (no lib-common.sh dependency for simplicity)
- Validates git repository context before proceeding
- Creates new branch with the worktree in a single operation
- Handles existing worktrees gracefully (proceeds to open Claude Code)
- Provides clear error messages and usage information

## Testing
- Verified worktree creation at correct path: `{repo}.worktrees/{branch-name}`
- Confirmed script has correct executable permissions
- Tested usage message and error handling
- Successfully cleaned up test worktree and branch
