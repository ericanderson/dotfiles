# Chezmoi Dotfiles Changes - August 18, 2025

## Summary

Added conditional SSL certificate configuration, automated chezmoi updates via LaunchAgent, and a system status MOTD.

## Changes

### 1. Enhanced Environment Configuration

- Added conditional SSL certificate configuration to `dot_env_common`
- Implemented logic to set SSL certificate paths only when corporate bundle exists
- Added exports for NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS and SSL_CERT_FILE environment variables

### 2. Automated Chezmoi Updates

- Added LaunchAgent to periodically update chezmoi (`Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.chezmoi.update.plist`)
- Created post-apply script to load and enable the LaunchAgent (`run_after_enable-chezmoi-launchagent.sh`)
- LaunchAgent runs daily at 10:00 AM with safety checks for internet connectivity and clean git state
- Updated `.chezmoiignore` to selectively allow LaunchAgent files while keeping other Library files excluded
- Enhanced LaunchAgent loading script to handle macOS security restrictions gracefully
- Added dedicated script for automatic updates (`bin/chezmoi-auto-update.sh`) for improved reliability

### 3. System Status Message of the Day (MOTD)

- Added a `motd` script to `bin/` for displaying system status and chezmoi updates
- Shows macOS version, date, uptime, and chezmoi update status
- Integrated with shell to display on login (throttled to once per day)
- Added quick command reference for common chezmoi operations
