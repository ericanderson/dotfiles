# Chezmoi Dotfiles Changes - August 19, 2025

## Summary

Fixed git status display in zsh prompt to properly update after git operations.

## Changes

### 1. Fixed Git Status in ZSH Prompt

- Modified `dot_zsh_custom/themes/eanderson.zsh-theme` to properly evaluate git status dynamically
- Moved git status function calls (`git_commits_ahead` and `git_commits_behind`) directly into PROMPT variable
- Simplified the git prompt suffix to be a static string
- Removed previously attempted periodic refresh mechanism as it's no longer needed
- Git status now automatically updates correctly after git operations

### 2. Preserved VSCode Git Integration Configuration

- Documented VSCode mergetool and difftool configurations in `dot_gitconfig.tmpl`
- Ensured settings are properly managed by chezmoi
