# Chezmoi Dotfiles Changes - August 19, 2025

## Summary

Fixed git status display in zsh prompt to properly update after git operations. Added Nerd Font icons system for use in scripts and shell configurations.

## Changes

### 1. Fixed Git Status in ZSH Prompt

- Modified `dot_zsh_custom/themes/eanderson.zsh-theme` to properly evaluate git status dynamically
- Moved git status function calls (`git_commits_ahead` and `git_commits_behind`) directly into PROMPT variable
- Simplified the git prompt suffix to be a static string
- Removed previously attempted periodic refresh mechanism as it's no longer needed
- Git status now automatically updates correctly after git operations

### 2. Preserved VSCode Git Integration Configuration

- Documented VSCode mergetool and difftool configurations in `dot_gitconfig.tmpl`
- Ensured settings are properly managed by chezmoi

### 3. Added Nerd Font Icons System

- Created `dot_config/nerdfonts/glyphnames.json` with all available Nerd Font icon definitions
- Implemented a TypeScript generator script at `bin/nerdfonts/generate-nf-icons.ts` that converts the JSON to bash variables
- Generated `bin/nerdfonts/nf-icons.sh` with direct variable exports for all icons
- Created `bin/nerdfonts/test-icons.sh` to verify and demonstrate icon usage
- Icons can be accessed via environment variables: `$NF_FA_GITHUB`
- Organized icons by their prefix groups (FA_, DEV_, COD_, etc.)
- Converted all icon names from kebab-case to SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE with NF_ prefix
- Proper handling of Unicode characters for terminal display
