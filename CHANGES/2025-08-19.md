# Chezmoi Dotfiles Changes - August 19, 2025

## Summary

Fixed git status display in zsh prompt to properly update after git operations.

## Changes

### 1. Fixed Git Status in ZSH Prompt

- Modified `dot_zsh_custom/themes/eanderson.zsh-theme` to properly evaluate git status dynamically
- Used proper escaping with `\$(git_commits_ahead)` to ensure the function runs on each prompt display
- Added `%{...%}` escape sequences to ensure proper prompt length calculation
- Removed previously attempted periodic refresh mechanism as it's no longer needed
- Git status now automatically updates correctly without manual intervention

### 2. Preserved VSCode Git Integration Configuration

- Documented VSCode mergetool and difftool configurations in `dot_gitconfig.tmpl`
- Ensured settings are properly managed by chezmoi
