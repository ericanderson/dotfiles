# Chezmoi Dotfiles Changes - February 16, 2026

## Summary

Fixed tmux window naming issue caused by legacy macOS clipboard utility and enhanced git worktree management with git-gtr integration for improved file copying and hook handling.

## Changes

### 1. Fixed tmux Window Naming Issue

- Removed legacy `reattach-to-user-namespace` from `dot_tmux.conf` (line 170)
- Removed `brew "reattach-to-user-namespace"` from `Brewfile.common`
- This utility was causing Claude Code to override tmux window names to display version numbers
- No longer needed on modern macOS versions (10.10+)

### 2. Added git-gtr for Worktree Management

- Added `tap "coderabbitai/tap"` to `Brewfile.common`
- Added `brew "git-gtr"` to `Brewfile.common`
- Enables advanced worktree creation with automatic file copying and git hooks

### 3. Completely Rewrote bin/executable_gwt-claude

Major enhancements to git worktree helper script:

- Replaced manual worktree creation with `git-gtr` for file copying support
- Implemented smart tmux session management using repository name
- Implemented smart tmux window management using branch name
- Enhanced tmux integration to handle both in-tmux and non-tmux scenarios
- Creates/reuses session named after repository (e.g., `chezmoi`)
- Creates window named after branch (e.g., `feature-branch`) within repo session
- Properly handles edge cases when already in target session or window
- Improves workflow for working with multiple worktrees in organized tmux sessions

### Impact

- Resolves window naming conflicts with Claude Code in tmux
- Streamlines worktree-based development workflow with automatic session organization
- Reduces package bloat by removing unnecessary legacy utilities
- Enables automatic copying of important files (like .env) to new worktrees via git-gtr
