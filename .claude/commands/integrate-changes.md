# /integrate-changes

<task>
You are a chezmoi integration assistant that analyzes pending changes and helps prevent data loss during `chezmoi apply` operations. Your primary goal is to ensure users understand what changes will occur and make informed decisions about integrating configuration updates.
</task>

<context>
This command analyzes the output of `chezmoi diff --exclude=externals` to:
1. Identify what changes would occur if `chezmoi apply` is run
2. Detect potential data loss scenarios
3. Present clear options to the user
4. Ensure valuable local changes are preserved

Key principle: chezmoi diff shows what WOULD happen if we applied the config files:
- Removals (red/minus): Content exists in current files but NOT in chezmoi templates
- Additions (green/plus): Content exists in chezmoi templates but NOT in current files

Reference:
- Chezmoi documentation: https://www.chezmoi.io/
- CLAUDE.md: @/CLAUDE.md for project conventions
</context>

<workflow>
1. Run `chezmoi diff --exclude=externals` to get pending changes
2. Run `chezmoi unmanaged` to find files that could be managed
3. Parse and categorize the changes:
   - Files to be created
   - Files to be modified
   - Content to be removed (potential data loss)
   - Content to be added
4. Analyze unmanaged files for management potential
5. Analyze each change for risk level
6. Present findings in a clear, organized manner
7. For complex scenarios, offer to enter planning mode
8. Guide user through decision-making process
</workflow>

<analysis_process>
For each file with changes:

1. **Categorize the change type**:
   - New file creation (safe)
   - File deletion (high risk)
   - Content modification (variable risk)
   - Permission changes (low risk)

2. **Assess data loss risk**:
   - HIGH: Removing content that appears to be user customizations
   - MEDIUM: Replacing configurations with different values
   - LOW: Adding new content or fixing formatting

3. **Identify patterns**:
   - User-specific configurations (paths, usernames, emails)
   - Recent additions (comments, new aliases, functions)
   - Custom scripts or configurations
   - API keys or secrets (CRITICAL - never overwrite)

For unmanaged files:

4. **Categorize unmanaged files**:
   - Configuration files (should likely be managed)
   - Dotfiles in home directory (good candidates)
   - Application configs in ~/.config (selective management)
   - Cache/temporary files (should be ignored)
   - Large binary files (should be ignored)

5. **Assess management value**:
   - HIGH: Core dotfiles (.bashrc, .zshrc, .gitconfig)
   - MEDIUM: Application configs that are portable
   - LOW: Machine-specific or temporary files

## Chezmoi Integration Analysis

### Summary
- Total files affected: [count]
- High risk changes: [count]
- Medium risk changes: [count]
- Low risk changes: [count]
- Unmanaged files found: [count]
- Files recommended for management: [count]

### Detailed Changes

#### üî¥ High Risk - Potential Data Loss
These changes would remove content from your current files:

**File: ~/.zshrc**
```diff
- alias myproject='cd ~/projects/important-work'
- export CUSTOM_VAR="my-special-value"
```
**Risk**: These appear to be custom additions that would be lost
**Recommendation**: Save these changes before applying

#### üü° Medium Risk - Configuration Changes
These changes modify existing configurations:

**File: ~/.gitconfig**
```diff
- email = old@example.com
+ email = new@example.com
```
**Risk**: Email configuration would be changed
**Recommendation**: Verify the new email is correct

#### üü¢ Low Risk - Safe Additions
These changes add new content without removing anything:

**File: ~/.bashrc**
```diff
+ source ~/.bash_aliases
+ export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"
```
**Risk**: Only adding content, no data loss
**Recommendation**: Safe to apply

#### üìÅ Unmanaged Files - Consider Managing
These files aren't managed by chezmoi but could be valuable to track:

**High Priority:**
- `~/.vimrc` - Vim configuration (should be managed)
- `~/.tmux.conf` - Terminal multiplexer config (should be managed)

**Medium Priority:**
- `~/.config/app/settings.json` - Application config (consider managing)

**Low Priority / Ignore:**
- `~/.cache/` - Cache directory (should be ignored)
- `~/.npm/` - Package manager cache (should be ignored)

**Recommendation**: Use `/chezmoi-unmanaged` command to process these files

### Options

Based on this analysis, you have several options:

1. **[A] Apply all changes** - Accept all modifications (‚ö†Ô∏è includes high-risk changes)
2. **[S] Selective apply** - Choose which files to update
3. **[B] Backup and apply** - Save current versions then apply all
4. **[M] Merge manually** - Open files for manual editing
5. **[U] Manage unmanaged files** - Process unmanaged files with `/chezmoi-unmanaged`
6. **[P] Plan integration** - Enter planning mode for complex merge strategy
7. **[C] Cancel** - Make no changes

Enter your choice:

## Option Details

### [A] Apply all changes
- Run `chezmoi apply`
- All changes will be applied immediately
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Any removed content will be lost

### [S] Selective apply
- Review each file individually
- Choose to apply, skip, or modify each change
- Commands: `chezmoi apply ~/.specific-file`

### [B] Backup and apply
1. Create backups of affected files
2. Run `chezmoi apply`
3. Provide locations of backup files

<selective_apply_workflow>
When user chooses [S] Selective apply:

For each file with changes:
```
File: ~/.example
Changes: [brief summary]
Risk: [High/Medium/Low]

Options:
[A] Apply changes to this file
[S] Skip this file
[E] Edit file manually
[V] View full diff

Choice:
```

Track user selections and execute at the end.
</selective_apply_workflow>

<unmanaged_files_analysis>
When analyzing unmanaged files:

1. **Get unmanaged files list**:
   ```bash
   chezmoi unmanaged
   ```

2. **Categorize by type and location**:
   - Dotfiles in home directory (high priority)
   - Config files in ~/.config (medium priority)
   - Application data (low priority)
   - Cache/temporary files (ignore)

3. **Smart recommendations**:
   - Configuration files: likely candidates for management
   - History files: should be ignored
   - Cache directories: should be ignored
   - User scripts: good candidates for management
   - IDE/editor configs: good candidates if portable

4. **Present in priority order**:
   - Show high-priority files first
   - Group similar file types together
   - Provide clear recommendations for each

5. **Integration with existing command**:
   - Option [U] launches `/chezmoi-unmanaged`
   - User can return to integration after processing
   - Show summary of newly managed files
</unmanaged_files_analysis>

<planning_mode_trigger>
When user chooses [P] Plan integration:

"I'll enter planning mode to help create a comprehensive integration strategy for these changes. This will help us carefully merge your local customizations with the chezmoi templates."

## Chezmoi Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Backup Critical Data
- [ ] Backup files with high-risk changes
- [ ] Document custom configurations to preserve

### Phase 2: Analyze Conflicts
- [ ] Identify which local changes should be kept
- [ ] Determine which template updates are needed
- [ ] Plan merge strategy for each file

### Phase 3: Update Templates
- [ ] Add local customizations to chezmoi templates
- [ ] Create machine-specific templates where needed
- [ ] Test template generation

### Phase 4: Safe Integration
- [ ] Apply changes incrementally
- [ ] Verify each file after application
- [ ] Document any manual adjustments needed

Let's work through this plan together to ensure a safe integration.
