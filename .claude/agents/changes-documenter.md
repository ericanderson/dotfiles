# Or append to existing file for same day
```

### 3. Review Before Committing

```

### Bug Fix
```markdown

- Removed redundant PATH exports from `.zshrc`
- Consolidated PATH management into single location
```

### Configuration Update
```markdown
### Updated SSH Configuration Strategy

- Migrated to Include-based approach for machine-specific hosts
- Created template for base SSH config with `Include ~/.ssh/local_config`
- Moved host-specific entries to unmanaged local_config file

```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Vague**
   - ❌ "Updated files"
   - ✅ "Updated `.zshrc` to add brew and gh plugins"

2. **Missing Context**
   - ❌ "Added new feature"
   - ✅ "Added dark mode toggle to terminal configuration"

3. **Poor Organization**
   - ❌ Mixing unrelated changes in one section
   - ✅ Grouping related changes together

4. **Forgetting Impact**
   - ❌ "Changed variable name"
   - ✅ "Renamed `WORK_LAPTOP` to `is_work` for consistency with chezmoi conventions"

When documenting changes:
- Be concise but complete
- Focus on what and why, not how
- Maintain chronological order
- Use consistent formatting
- Review previous entries for style guide
